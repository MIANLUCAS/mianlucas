Configurable shipping discount rules based on the amount spent for the items with a given shipping class.

== Description ==
**WooCommerce Shipping Discount** allows you to configure shipping discount based on the amount spent for the items with a given shipping class.
It works as a discount from the order in the form of reduced shipping rate, so it allows you to offer **free shipping** for items that are cheaper to ship and discounted shipping for items that are more expensive to ship as well as cheaper international shipping.

== Features ==
* Configure different rule for each shipping class.
* Ability to require minimum order amount of the products with a given shipping class.
* Reduce shipping rate on the percentage from the order amount spent for the product that match a rule.
* Ability to deduct total sale discount from the shipping discount, so in cases when customer already saved a lot of money, because of the sale, their shipping discount will be lower.
* Ability to deduct total coupon discount from the shipping discount, so in cases when customers applied coupons, the amount they've already saved will reduce shipping discount.
* Ability to enable debug mode, so you can troubleshoot issues.
